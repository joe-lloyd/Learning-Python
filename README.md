# Python Programming Course

This Python programming course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about Python for becoming proficient in the language. The course is structured into 4 chapters, each focusing on different fundamental aspects of Python programming.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into chapters (WIP). A full list of chapters can be seen [here](lessons/index.md):

1. **Chapter 1: Introduction to Python & Basics** - This chapter covers installing Python, setting up the development environment, understanding Python syntax, exploring data types and control structures, and writing a basic Python program.

2. **Chapter 2: Data Structures** - In this chapter, you will learn about various Python data structures like lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, how to iterate over these data structures, and how to manipulate them.

3. **Chapter 3: Functions and Modules** - This chapter dives into defining and calling functions, understanding parameters and return values, exploring built-in functions and modules, and creating your own modules.

4. **Chapter 4: Exception Handling & File I/O** - In the final chapter, you will understand how to handle exceptions in Python and perform file input/output operations.

Each chapter is rounded off with a mini-project to apply the concepts you've learned.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you should:

- Have a solid understanding of Python syntax and data types
- Be able to write Python programs using control structures (like if, else, loops)
- Understand Python data structures and be able to manipulate them (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- Be able to write your own functions and modules in Python
- Understand how to handle exceptions in Python
- Be capable of reading from and writing to files in Python

## Projects

Each chapter ends with a mini-project that aims to apply the concepts learned in the chapter. The projects are:

- **Chapter 1 Mini-Project**: Write a Python program to perform basic arithmetic operations
- **Chapter 2 Mini-Project**: Write a program to manipulate a shopping list (add items, remove items, sort items)
- **Chapter 3 Mini-Project**: Write a module that performs operations on a list (such as add, remove, search)
- **Chapter 4 Mini-Project**: Write a program to manage a text file.

## Getting Started

You need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/. 

It is also recommended to install a Python IDE or text editor. Some popular choices are PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, or Atom.

Happy coding!
